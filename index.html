		<p>Welcome to my portfolio page!  My name is David Gray, and I am an aspiring web application developer.  This page was made for the purpose of showing off my chops in HTML and CSS, and will eventually evolve to include some interesting javascript, and hopefully some backend logic as well.  At least that's the plan, anyway.</p>  
		<p>I kind of see this as a work in progress that will be taking the pulse of my skillset as I progress through my journey of learning how to code.  Feel free to send a message through the contact page or take a look at my portfolio, where I have created a fully-equipped ecommerce site for a fictitious purveyor of fine sauces using Wordpress (before I knew much at all about HTML or CSS).  Other projects are either in progress or just beginning to germinate in the back of my mind.  I encourage you to come back often to see how I'm doing, especially if you are hiring!</p>
